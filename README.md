# flappy bird mouth 🐤🗣️

This is a fun twist on the classic Flappy Bird game — instead of tapping a key or clicking, the bird flaps when *you open your mouth*! Using real-time face detection and mouth-tracking through your webcam, your facial movement becomes the controller.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Open your mouth** to make the bird jump.
- Try to fly through the pipes without crashing.
- The longer you survive, the higher your score!

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time mouth detection via webcam
- Simple and responsive controls (just your face!)
- Classic side-scrolling Flappy Bird gameplay

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV** – for webcam input and face/mouth tracking
- **Pygame** – for rendering game graphics and handling game logic

## 📸 Requirements

Make sure you have a working webcam. The game uses it to detect when your mouth is open.
